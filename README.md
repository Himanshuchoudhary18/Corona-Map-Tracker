# Corona-Map-Tracker
This is corona virus cases tracking on map project
#STEPS:
1) First we created a HTML file where we imported map from third party resource
2) Then we give it width and height so, that it can perfectly fit on any resolution (and made it responsive)
3) Then by using JS, i took API from third party app (wwhich was covid active cases from govt. webite) and with the help of that i used blue marker to denote (less casses) and red marker for (high cases and dangerous condition) on the map
4) The API updates the covid cases after every 24 hour
